# make301

A quick script I wrote at work to generate a list of 301 redirects from a .csv a client provided.

 This script parses a file called "errors.csv" and outputs a file called "301-fix.txt" in the same directory
 Future modifications could allow for users to specify arguments from the command line, and could use a nonspecific regsub string

 To use:
 Change the regsub command to substitute the proper uri for the redirects
 Use the proper "puts" command for the relevant rewrite rule style (Redirect 301 or RewriteRule â€“ I don't know if it matters)

 a) open terminal and enter "tclsh make301.tcl"
 or
 b) open terminal and enter "chmod u+x make301.tcl" to give the user permission to execute the file, then just type "./make301.tcl" to run the file in the command line.
